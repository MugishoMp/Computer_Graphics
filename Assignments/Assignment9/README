- **Setup OpenGL and SDL2 Environment**
   - **Assignment**: Make a square that has blending colors

Step 0:

    Setup project, Create appropriate Classes and functions to get a functional window running

    Render a Traingle, grass in 3d

    Render a square, the field, in 3d space

    Combine the two meshes

    Add ability to change camera and rotate around this field (rotate around the origin)

Step 1: Grass Clusters

   Instance Your Grass: Instead of having just one grass triangle, you'll want to create many instances of this grass. This can be done using instanced rendering in OpenGL. You'll create many copies of the grass triangle across your plane.

   Randomize Position: Each grass instance should have a slightly different position to give a natural look. You can add randomness to the position within a certain range.

   Vary Size and Rotation: Similarly, slightly vary the size and rotation of each grass instance to add realism.

Step 2: Basic Animation

    Vertex Shader: Write a vertex shader that can animate each blade of grass. The vertex shader will be responsible for moving the vertices of the grass mesh.

    Simple Swaying: Start with a simple animation, like having each blade of grass sway back and forth. This can be achieved using a sine wave function based on time, affecting the rotation or position of the grass vertices.

Step 3: Wind Simulation

    Wind Direction: Implement a uniform variable in your shader to represent wind direction. This can be a 2D vector that influences the sway of the grass.

    Wind Strength: Similarly, add a variable for wind strength, affecting how much the grass sways.

    Noise Function: Introduce a noise function like Perlin or Worley noise to make the wind effect more natural. Worley noise can give a more cellular, varied pattern to the wind's influence on different parts of the grass.

Step 4: Advanced Shader Enhancements

    Fragment Shader: Develop your fragment shader to add color and possibly texture to the grass. You can use a simple green gradient or a more complex grass texture.

    Lighting: Implement basic lighting in your shader to give depth and realism to the grass.

Step 5: Optimization

    Level of Detail (LOD): Implement LOD to reduce the detail of grass that's further away from the camera.

    Culling: Implement frustum culling to avoid rendering grass that's outside the camera's view.

    Batch Rendering: Optimize your rendering calls to handle the large number of grass instances efficiently.

Step 6: Additional Effects

    Interaction with Objects/Characters: If you want the grass to react to other objects or characters moving through it, you'll need to implement a way for the grass to respond to these interactions in your shaders.

    Environmental Effects: Consider adding environmental effects like rain or varying wind patterns for more realism.







i am using worley noise function to decide where and at what point the grass blade moves
    a noise function is a mathematical function that generates random or pseudorandom values, often used to
    introduce randomness or variability in computer graphis, simulations and procedural content generation
i am using the worley nose to change the color of the grass as it goes down by making use of the uv
i am using the rodriguez rotation formula to decide in what direction it sways and how much it sways
i am using instancing to generate multiple grass blades without having a ridiculously large VBO
